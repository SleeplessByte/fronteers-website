title: W3C Advisory Board meetup
---

On the 18th of June the W3C Advisory Board is in Amsterdam for a meeting. They would like to take the opportunity to meet with the local community of front-end enthusiasts!

The W3C Advisory Board is a group of elected professionals (elected by the W3C Advisory Committee), responsible for discussing strategy, finances, governance and various other important matters. The W3C Advisory Board provides advice on all these topics.

Join us on the 18th of June for a meetup organised by the W3C Advisory Board and Fronteers and learn more about this side of the W3C. How does the W3C work as a consortium, what does the pipeline for specifications look like, what the W3C expects for the future and how front-end developers can get involved at the various stages of work of the W3C.

This meetup is open to everyone interested in Front-End development, member or non-member of Fronteers.
