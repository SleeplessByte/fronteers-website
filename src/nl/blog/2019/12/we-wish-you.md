These last days of the year are a time to look back at what you did the past year and to look forward to what's to come. At Fronteers we can look back at a great year. We became a member of the [W3C](https://fronteers.nl/blog/2019/01/fronteers-is-w3c-lid), [Fronteers Conference](https://vimeo.com/channels/fronteersconf19) was amazing as always and we hosted a couple of awesome [workshops](https://fronteers.nl/workshops).

And we also have a lot to look forward to. We're gonna present a new design for our identity, we're starting work at our new website and of course there will be more workshops and in the autumn another edition of Fronteers Conference.

We hope you had a great 2019 and we wish you a happy christmas and a sparkling 2020. Of course, our volunteers have some new year's wishes for you too.
